  - I think I can finish it so you guyd can work on the other ones I will help ones I finish it



## Ex3

- Leave any notes you think are important here pls
1. There are 26 possible alphabets when using shifting and 26! when using mixed alphabte since each letter has
26 - n possible combinations where n is the number of letters already being used

2. No it does not make it harder to break since it is possible to stack the operation on one another and then we will still perform only one operation
on the cipher. In theory it is a hard to break cipher because there are 26! possible alphabets since we use the mixed alphabet. Thus effectively the
attacker needs to try at most 26! possible combinations

3. Yes it can be used: if we have a shift of 3 on the alphabet then decrypt of 3 will just be the same as encrypt but we will frist need to 
reverse the alphabet and perform the shift. So yes the encrypt function can be used for decrypting we just need to add this condition to determine which
operation we will be doing
